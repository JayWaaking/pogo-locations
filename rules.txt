Rules Reminder:\n1. Keep the language and posting family-friendly. No offensive language, videos, pictures, etc...\n2. If you post a raid (include a screenshot of the egg/boss with a timer), let everyone know if you’re going attend or just sharing the information. If you are hosting the raid, post a time that most people can agree on. Allow for travel and organizing on-site, so 20-30 minutes is desirable. \"Soldiers, hatches at 10:20, FYI\" \"Soldiers, Level 5, 10:30AM start time\" or something similar.\n3. We only use public lobbies unless there is chance you have over 20 accounts at a raid. Only use private codes when you have to split the group, or when you suspect a spoofer.\n4. Be clear about your comments. If you commit to a raid, say which raid you are attending, and post your account level. There may be multiple raids going on at once, and no one likes confusion. "2 accounts for Soldiers, Lvls 29 34\" or something similar.\n5. Keep the chat about raids during raid hours. Limit brag posts while people are raiding. Feel free to share after 7:30PM, on the Pokestop page, in the Nerd-ening(off-topic chat), or Discord. Ask for links.\n6. Admins and Raid Commanders have priority at raids. If organization is required, Admins and Raid Commanders can take control of a raid, if they see fit. They can split the group, or change raid times to allow for everyone to play.\n7. We include EVERYONE who wants to raid.  Absolutely no one is excluded, even people who have been banned from the chat or raid page.  No one will be left out.\n8. Please do not change the chat color, title, or picture.  This affects the whole chat, not just you.
